	This repository is the third phase of a stdent project which aims to clone the
[AirBnB website]([airbnb.com). Prior to this project the project did all of it's storage operations to files, there are many disadvantages to this approach of
file storage the most notable one being it's lack of volatility.
	In this phase we will integrate MySQL in order to be able to save data to databases rather than to files, the python package SQLAlchemy will be used to
link to a MySQL database and make queries to perform several operations.
